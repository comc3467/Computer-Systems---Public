Binary manipulation lab uses C language to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers â€“ puzzling but very fun!

Bomb lab explores machine code a bit.

Attack lab continues to explore machine code, further understanding ways to manipulate the registers therein to perform 'attacks' on programs.

Performance lab basically gives a C++ program for applying filters to photographs, and the task was to use techniques such as loop unrolling, call optimization, 
data structure size altercation, and efficient loop traversal to speed the program up, diving into the effects that 'how a computer thinks' has on speed.

Linux shell lab required the use of parent and child functions as well as signals to create a shell in C++.
